# count-triangles-in-networks

We are using three baseline algorithms (**Brute-Force**, **Node-Iterator**, **Compact-Forward**) to __count the triangles__ in three different-sized networks, retrieved from __SNAP__.
Afterwards, we are usign **DOULION** algorithm to sparsify the graphs and achieve speedups, while calculating accuracies and relative errors.
Finally we apply **Triest** algorithm for streaming.
